설명

1. Initial Setup
a. Unity Environment

Unity Project: You have a Unity project set up for a rhythm game.
ML-Agents Toolkit: Unity's ML-Agents toolkit is integrated into the project, allowing for reinforcement learning (RL) to be used.
b. Game Components

RhythmGameManager: Manages the overall game state, including loading songs, setting difficulty, and simulating player performance.
AudioAnalysisLoader: Analyzes audio files to extract features like tempo and beat times.
RhythmGameNoteGenerator: Generates game notes based on the audio analysis.

2. Agent Definition
a. DifficultyAgent Class

Inherits from Agent: The DifficultyAgent class inherits from the Agent class provided by ML-Agents.
Purpose: This agent will learn to adjust the difficulty of the rhythm game to provide an optimal challenge for players.
b. Key Methods

OnEpisodeBegin: Resets the game state and sets the initial difficulty at the start of each training episode.
CollectObservations: Collects observations (features) from the game environment, such as tempo, note density, and rhythm complexity.
OnActionReceived: Receives actions from the agent (adjustments to difficulty), applies them, simulates player performance, and calculates rewards.
Heuristic: Provides a manual control option for testing (optional).
CalculateReward: Calculates the reward based on how well the difficulty matches the player’s skill level.

3. Training Configuration
a. YAML Configuration

Trainer Type: Specifies the use of the PPO algorithm.
Hyperparameters: Defines the training parameters such as batch size, buffer size, learning rate, and others.
Network Settings: Configures the neural network used by the agent, including the number of hidden units and layers.
Reward Signals: Specifies the reward signals, with a gamma of 0.99 and strength of 1.0.
Training Steps: Defines the maximum training steps and summary frequency for logging progress.

4. Training Process
a. Data Collection

Episodes: Each training episode begins by resetting the game state and loading a new song.
Observations: The agent collects observations about the current game state, including features from audio analysis and note generation.
b. Action and Reward

Action: The agent makes decisions to adjust the game difficulty.
Simulation: The game simulates player performance based on the current difficulty.
Reward Calculation: The agent receives a reward based on how well the difficulty matches an optimal player performance level.
c. Learning

Policy Update: The agent updates its policy based on the collected data and received rewards, aiming to improve its performance over time.
Logging: Training progress is logged at specified intervals for monitoring.

5. Using the Trained Agent
a. DifficultyRecommender Class

Purpose: Provides an interface to use the trained DifficultyAgent to recommend game difficulty levels.
b. Key Method

RecommendDifficulty: Calls the agent’s RequestDecision method to make a difficulty adjustment decision and returns the current difficulty.

6. Integration in the Game
a. Game Flow

Game Initialization: The game initializes the DifficultyAgent and DifficultyRecommender.
Recommendation Request: When a difficulty recommendation is needed, the game calls RecommendDifficulty.
Difficulty Adjustment: The DifficultyAgent processes the request and updates the difficulty level.
Gameplay: The game proceeds with the recommended difficulty, aiming to provide an optimal challenge based on the player's performance.
